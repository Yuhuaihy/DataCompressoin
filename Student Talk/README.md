Abstract：
This paper contributes to improving deep face recognition from data refinement, network settings and loss function designs.To enhance the discriminative power of the Soft- max loss, multiplicative angular margin and additive cosine margin, incorporate angular margin and cosine margin into the loss functions, respectively. This paper proposed a novel supervisor signal, additive angular margin (ArcFace), which has a better geometrical interpretation than supervision signals proposed so far. Specifically, the proposed ArcFace cos(θ+m) directly maximise decision boundary in angular (arc) space based on the L2 normalised weights and features. Compared to multiplicative angular margin cos(mθ) and additive cosine margin cosθ−m, ArcFace can obtain more discriminative deep features. Extensive experiments on several relevant face recognition benchmarks, LFW, CFP and AgeDB, prove the effectiveness of the proposed ArcFace.
